      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Alan and Riana met online in December 2021. We got engaged on February 14, 2023 and moved into our tiny house on May 10, 2023.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As you may know we are quite cost-conscious, and we do not want to impose extra costs on our guests. We also would like to be able to spend quality time with everyone. Given these, we decided to have a weekend getaway at a local camping/cottage resort, with a non-legal ceremony to affirm our commitment to each other.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While we hope to be able to celebrate this special occasion with all of you, we understand if you cannot or prefer not to come. We know that this might not be your idea of a fun time and do not want anyone to feel any obligation to attend, especially if this does not fit well within your schedule, budget or (for those of you not in Ottawa) your travel plans. If this is the case, we hope we can find another time to celebrate with you in the near future!</p>

      <h2>Event Details</h2>
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>The venue is called Long Island Recreational & Conference Centre (<a href='http://www.folic.ca'>website</a>), and is located on the Rideau River between Manotick and Barrhaven in the south of Ottawa (<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Long+Island+Recreational+%26+Conference+Centre,+Nicolls+Island+Rd,+Ottawa,+ON+K4M+0E2/@45.2559239,-75.7037716,18z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x4ccde378a58a1869:0xc8811bbf9c108e67!2m2!1d-75.7035901!2d45.2562676!3e0?entry=ttu'>directions</a>). It is a facility with 14 cabins, around a conference center with two adjacent halls. Each cabin sleeps up to six people and has electricity. There is also a playground, basketball court, fire pit, BBQ pit area, picnic area, and plenty of green space. There are campsite showers and flushing toilets available.</p>

      <h3>Gifts</h3>
      <p>We are certain of, and appreciate, everyone's generosity, but we are incredibly fortunate to have everything we need and we would like to kindly request no gifts. Kindly, but firmly, because we know that sometimes couples ask for no gifts but most people give gifts anyway!</p>
      <br>
      <p>We understand that you lovely folks may still wish to contribute somehow, so if that is the case you can help us to make the weekend possible by assisting with making the weekend a success – by helping with meal preparation and cleanup, carpooling, lending out extra sleeping bags and games, picking up supplies we have ordered, and so on.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you really really insist, we will accept <em>anonymous</em> cash contributions towards the accommodation/food costs (anonymous because we don't want anyone to feel obligated to contribute any specific amount).</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you STILL want to give us a gift, please consider eating one or more vegan meals in our honour, before or after the wedding, OR donating to <strong><a href='https://animalcharityevaluators.org'>Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, <a href='https://80000hours.org'>80,000 Hours</a>, or <a href='https://www.givewell.org'>GiveWell</a>.</strong> If you have any questions about these, we would be happy to talk about them!</p>
      <h3>Dress Code</h3>
      <article>
        <p>We encourage you to wear whatever you prefer and are comfortable in for the whole time! For the ceremony you may wish to wear something nice, but you could wear sweats, PJs and crocs, or cargo shorts and a blazer, or a Halloween costume. Actually you should definitely wear a Halloween costume.</p>

      <h3>Travel</h3>
        <article>
          <img src='./photos/ouimet.jpg' alt='cute couple'>
          <p>For those of you coming in from outside of Ottawa, there are three main ways to get to the nation's capital: by car, by train, or by plane. It's a relatively easy drive from Toronto, along the faster Highway 401 route or the more scenic Highway 7 route. The Via Rail stops in Fallowfield, which is a 15-minute drive to the venue. The Ottawa International Airport is about a 20-minute drive to the venue. </p>
        </article>
        <p>Within Ottawa, the options for getting around are driving, cabbing (Uber, Lyft, Blue Line Taxi, and Capital Taxi are all options), or public transit (run by OC Transpo). Once we know who is attending the event, and who can offer or benefit from carpooling, we will make additional arrangements to help everyone get around within Ottawa.</p>

      <ol>
      <li><strong>Museums:</strong> Ottawa is home to many museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, Canadian Museum of History, Canada Science and Technology Museum, Canada Aviation and Space Museum, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian War Museum and Canada Agriculture and Food Museum.

      <li><strong>Trails and hiking:</strong> One of our favourite things about Ottawa is the plentiful green space and numerous trails for walking, hiking and biking.

If you would like help planning a hike or outdoor excursion, let us know.</li>
